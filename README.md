# time-tracker
I like to keep track of how much time I spend coding in a day. To do this, I used to open a tab with an online timer, then frantically search for the tab when the annoying beeps went off, then noting down the time I tracked in a notebook, then at the end of the day manually adding all of the minutes. Clearly, this workflow could be improved with automation.

In this implementation, you set a timer for a chosen number of minutes. When the time is up, a soft gong goes off, and the time you just tracked is added to the total (kept in local storage). You can also manually add any minutes you forgot to track (or add a negative number if you forget about the timer when you go out for hot chocolate.)
