next step: 
make the message be updated after timer ends
figure out where the random numbers are coming from 

current state: 
setting the inner html after running the timer does nothing 

hypotheses:
* there's something around defering or returning 0 
that I need to do? 
options:
* make timer also work in category 
* make format of message better

* make clear storage work in category 

(the end state might just be that the
message is only displayed for selected category?)

design:
* category goes on top, 
everything else is in a box


make backspace work

possible extensions:
* design [goal: user understands at first glance 
how to use]
- title, subtitle, icon
- make timer look like timer 
- "add manually" instead of "minutes to add" 
( with greyed out time)
- reset instead of clear storage 
- make reset button smaller 

* make clear storage reversible
* responsive design
* make it pretty
* track time by category 
* track time by day 
* store time from previous days 
- firebase?? 

bonus: 
* notes or intentions 

responsive design
- remove node modules from github
