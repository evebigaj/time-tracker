next step: 
* clean up code so that category and
category.value mistakes don't happen
* make time be stored for all categories: 
> figure out if there's a way to loop through 
everything in local storage 


make backspace work

possible extensions:
* design [goal: user understands at first glance 
how to use]
- title, subtitle, icon
- make timer look like timer 
- "add manually" instead of "minutes to add" 
( with greyed out time)
- reset instead of clear storage 
- make reset button smaller 

* make clear storage reversible
* responsive design
* make it pretty
* track time by category 
* track time by day 
* store time from previous days 
- firebase?? 

bonus: 
* notes or intentions 

responsive design
- remove node modules from github
