make countdown happen inside countdown box 
make 'x' formatting better 
make start and submit buttons better 
make category summary closer to the rest 
make pretty colorful boxes 

styling:
make category be on top and the minutes to add 
and timer side by side



adding to category does not add to total 
(but adding uncategorized does?)

current behavior:
the 'x' sometimes removes a different entry

next step:
figure out why

figure out why onclick isn't working

next to each category label, have a button 
that says "x"
its id is the key (label) 
and onclick, it removes the 

* make total show up at bottom 
now want: remove category 

so minimum stylistic things:
make the tracked things appear on the right of screen
make it minutes to add 
so 10 seconds is 1/6 = 
current state: it's chopping off a digit instead
of rounding it off (it's always rounding down)

so the thing to do is figure out how to 
r
ok, so next options are either make the messages
readable
or style the page otherwise 

well both have to be done... 

next step: 
make the message be updated after timer ends
figure out where the random numbers are coming from 

current state: 
setting the inner html after running the timer does nothing 

hypotheses:
* there's something around defering or returning 0 
that I need to do? 
options:
* make timer also work in category 
* make format of message better

* make clear storage work in category 

(the end state might just be that the
message is only displayed for selected category?)

design:
* category goes on top, 
everything else is in a box


make backspace work

possible extensions:
* design [goal: user understands at first glance 
how to use]
- title, subtitle, icon
- make timer look like timer 
- "add manually" instead of "minutes to add" 
( with greyed out time)
- reset instead of clear storage 
- make reset button smaller 

* make clear storage reversible
* responsive design
* make it pretty
* track time by category 
* track time by day 
* store time from previous days 
- firebase?? 

bonus: 
* notes or intentions 

responsive design
- remove node modules from github
