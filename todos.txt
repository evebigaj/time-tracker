bugs:
* adding to total after countdown clears memory
[hypothesis: two distinct memories/constants dependinig on whether the path is via countdown or manual add ]
* timers can run simultaneously (new timer doesn't clear old)

make it add time if timer was interrupted 
(or: react version: continually update)
add zeros
stop previous clock from running on new time set

* find out why you need a backend
